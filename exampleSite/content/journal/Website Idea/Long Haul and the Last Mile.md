# Website Idea - Long Haul and the Last Mile

Website to present a future transportation situation for cities.

The basic premise is that cars work up to a certain density, afterwhich they slowly fall apart as a solution. They either become slow, expensive, or unsafe. Taxis and TNCs alleviate a portion of the problem but not entirely.

There's an uncanny valley between "suburban" modes of transportation and "urban" modes of transportation. The transition from one mode to the other is difficult at a regional level and on a personal level. The gap from driving everywhere to riding everywhere is hard to cross, partly because driving or riding isn't just a decision about how to travel. It becomes a decision about where and how to live. 

For many it requires calculating a complicated set of economic tradeoffs. How many cars 0, 1, 2 cars? How much space can do I need? How much space can I afford? Is the market expensive because it's a bubble or does it represent the real cost of providing this type of housing?

For other it requires calculating things like the value of their time, the environment, proximity to family or friends or institutions or community.

There is an alternative, and that is the Long Haul and the Last Mile. Once a region crosses a certain density where cars stop working on their own, and transit isn't competetive with a dysfunctional car commute, there's a new alternative. The long haul and the last mile.

Because small electric motors have reached sufficient power levels. It's possible to be a mile or two miles from your long haul commute, and be only minutes away. That distance would have added 40 minutes to your commute before. Now it is 5 minutes. 

You can still live in a suburb that cars work in, while being connected to a city that work happens in. If your suburb builds last mile infrastructure within 2 miles of its freeways and transit hubs, it can stave off decades of expensive infrastructure projects. 

Peak capacity is when car networks fail, and that happens during commutes hours. Moving people into long haul modes that handle higher capacities, and handle them cheaper is what will differentiate regions that succeed from regions that stagnate.

The tech shuttles or "Google Buses" is one instantiation of the long haul. It took self-interested companies realizing that buses were necessary to deal with congested car commutes.

Cities that build out their last mile infrastructure will necessarily be the future of cities. If you can't fit more cars in your city, or are tired of the congestion, build last mile infrastructure. If it is not cost effective to run transit, build the last mile infrastructure. If your city doesn't have congestion and you want it to stay that way, tell these other cities to build the last mile infrastructure.
